    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Couscous is a Berber dish of small (about 3 millimetres (0.12 in) diameter) steamed balls of crushed durum wheat semolina that is traditionally served with a stew spooned on top. Pearl millet and sorghum, especially in the Sahel, and other cereals can be cooked in a similar way and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir cumin, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, paprika, cayenne pepper, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper into the onion mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken, carrots, zucchini, garbanzo beans, chicken broth, tomatoes, raisins, apricots, honey, and lemon juice into spice mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until the cornstarch dissolves; stir into the stew. Simmer until the stew has thickened, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
